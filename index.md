One of our most important challenges at Covered California is to make it easy for Californian citizens to enroll in health coverage. This requires us to create a seamless experience for consumers using a wide variety of devices across a number of different platforms, applications, tools, and website features. We’ve created this Styleguide to support our efforts with making the consumer jorney consistent, easy, and accessible for all.
