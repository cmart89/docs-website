One of our most important challenges at HealthCare.gov is to make it easy for American citizens to enroll in health coverage. This requires us to create a seamless experience for consumers using a wide variety of devices across a number of different platforms, applications, tools, and website features. We’ve created this Styleguide to support our efforts –and to open our work to the public. What we’re doing and why.
